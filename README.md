# Emotion Detection 

## Tools Used:
    deepface
    cv2
    matplotlib

## Work:
    Two of the most common emotions out of seven most common and base emotions 
    for humans are taken into consideration using the extensive libraries available 
    in Python like deepface, cv2 and matplotlib as well. The hashtag#face_confidence 
    therefore presents the outcome in form of prediction data. 
    
    The highly trained model testing on my very own 'personal gallery' of photos - 
    my smiling face photograph and an angry face.
    Deep Image Analysis was strictly completed using deepface library. 
    The model works quite great for real time pictures as much as it does for well posed ones; 
    until the basic facial muscles are showing or in short the face is visible.
